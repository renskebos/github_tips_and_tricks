# How to Make a Pull Request for ASReview  

Contributing to ASReview is a great way to support open-source research. But before you push 
changes, keep in mind that others are working on the same code. You want to avoid merge 
conflicts. Thatâ€™s why you should always work on your own branch and fork.  

## Step-by-step guide  

### Step 1: Fork the Synergy repository  

Go to the Synergy GitHub repository. Click Fork to create a copy in your own GitHub account.  

### Step 2: Include all branches  

When forking, uncheck 'Copy the main branch only' to include other branches like development/v2.  

### Step 3: Clone your fork  

Now, you have your own copy of the repository on git. Find the green Code button on GitHub, 
copy the URL. Clone it to your local machine:

```sh
git clone <your-fork-url>
```

### Step 4: Switch to the development branch  

You should never work directly on development/v2. But you do start by switching to it.

```sh
git checkout development/v2
```

Check if you are on the correct branch by running:

```sh
git branch
```

### Step 5: Create a new branch  

To avoid conflicts, make a branch for your changes (from development/v2):

```sh
git checkout -b branch_name
```

Give it a clear name, like add_dataset_name if you're adding a dataset.  

### Step 6: Make changes and commit  

Edit the files as needed. You can check the status of your changes using:

```sh
git status
```

Then, stage and commit your changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add dataset name"
```

Start the commit message with a verb, describing what you did.  

### Step 7: Push your changes  

Push to your fork:

```sh
git push
```

If you use GitHub Desktop, this step is easier.  

### Step 8: Create a pull request  

Go to your fork on GitHub, click Compare & pull request, and submit it to development/v2.  
Be mindful main is the default.  

### Step 9: Add a title and description  

Clearly describe your changes. This helps reviewers understand your work.  

### Step 10: Request a review  

Click on your pull request, then Request reviewers.  

### Step 11: Address feedback  

Reviewers may request changes. Make edits, commit, and push again.  
Your pull request updates automatically with your new changes.  

### Step 12: Done!  

Once approved, your changes are merged into ASReview.  

## Want to make another pull request?  

Before starting, update your fork to prevent conflicts:  

1. Sync your fork on GitHub.  
2. Pull the latest changes locally:  

   ```sh
   git checkout development/v2 
   git pull upstream development/v2
   ```

3. Create a new branch from development/v2:  

   ```sh
   git checkout -b new_branch_name
   ```

Check your branch with:

```sh
git branch
```

Then, follow the same steps!  

Now, you're ready to contribute to ASReview. Happy coding! ðŸš€
